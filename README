## Implementing Instant Search with Flask and HTMX

Instant search is a feature that shows search results as users type their query. Instead of waiting for a full page to reload or submitting a form, results appear instantly, allowing users to find what they are looking for more quickly. For example, when you start typing in a search box, suggestions or matching items will appear immediately, making the process smoother and more efficient.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple instant search feature using Flask and HTMX. This will help you build interactive web applications with a better user experience.
